# Townsquare

Web based implementation of the Doomtown card game ([Doomtown Online](https://doomtown.online)).

## About

Similarly as ringteki, this is based on the throneteki and uses large parts of the source. 
Townsquare is a fork of the throneteki sourcecode. The code is written in node.js(server) and react.js(client).  

This client is currently in beta stage.
